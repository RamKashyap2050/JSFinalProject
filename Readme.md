A Simple Tic Tac Toe Project 

In this Project We use a simple algorithm to validate who is the winner of the game 

The algorithm is as follows 

We have Nine input tags where we basically give our 'X's and 'O's  which validate who won if it's either player 1  and player 2 

All the functions involved in developing the project

my_func() => All the logic of the game for validating winner and displaying winner is included in this function

my_func2() => This function has all the logic for Reset Button and what it does

my_func3() to my_func11() => These functions decide the turns of the players

Refreshplayerschoice() => Refresh players choice basially empties all the input tags and and gets the board ready for another game

refreshgamecountdisplay() => This Basically display the number of games played in total

setscorecontent() => This function displays the score and updates it dynamically

clearmodal() => This function  clears the result modal
